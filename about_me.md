# About me

My name is Raúl, and I am originally from a small town in the Spanish south.

When I was 18 I decided that I wanted to become a theoretical physicist in order to do study the interplay between gravitation and quantum mechanics, and since then I have been devoted to becoming an accomplished researcher.

I studied in Sevilla and Madrid, and then moved to Granada in order to do research under the supervision of Carlos Barceló and Luis J. Garay. Since finishing my PhD in 2016, I have been a postdoctoral researcher, first at the University of Cape Town, then at SISSA, and later on at the Florida Space Institute.

I believe in the value of originality in any human activity, and science in particular. You may notice that my research activities usually take me along unexplored paths that deviate from mainstream trends. Whether this tendency is a bless or a curse, I am still unable to say.

Aside from my job, I like doing several things, with fluctuating interests over time. The most stable ones are reading (and, sometimes, just carrying around) history books, taking photographs, and cooking. I have a taste for learning languages; I am fluent in Spanish and English, know some Japanese and Italian, and have taken courses of Afrikaans and Slovene. I travel quite often and follow eSports.

Before doing physics I was into music production. Some of the songs that I created are still floating around the Internet (of course, under my artistic name!). When I feel like remembering this stage of my life, I listen to Pendulum, an Australian drum 'n' bass band.
